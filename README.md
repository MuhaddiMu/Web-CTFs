# Web Based 3 CTFs 
Beginner/Intermediate level web based CTF Coded in PHP. CTF belongs to Cryptography/Encryption.

### How to setup CTF
The Setup of these CTFs is not a rocket science. All you need to do is clone the repository. `git clone https://github.com/MuhaddiMu/Web-CTFs.git` and load the file in browser and boom.

Why PHP Code is obfuscated?
The actual password of CTFs are actually hardcoded in PHP. The reason of making code obfuscated is to not to know about the defined password. _I'm not saying the code cannot be converted back to its original form by reverse engineering or any decryption algorithm._
